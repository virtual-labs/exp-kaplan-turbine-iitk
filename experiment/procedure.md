1.	Add minimum load to the weight hanger of brake drum say 1 kg
2.	Close the main gate valve and start the pump
3.	Open the gate valve while monitoring the inlet pressure to the turbine and set it for the design value of 1 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>
4.	Open the cooling water valve for cooling the brake drum
5.	Measure the turbine RPM with the tachometer
6.	Note the pressure gauge and vacuum gauge reading at turbine inlet and outlet
7.	Note the venturi meter pressure gauge reading P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>
8.	Add additional weights and represent the experiment for both loads
9.	For constant speed test , the main valve has to be adjusted to reduce or increase the inlet head to turbine for varying loads
